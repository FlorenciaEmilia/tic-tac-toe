#❌⭕️Tic Tac Toe⭕️❌

This is a single player game where the user plays against computer logic. The logic consist in **attack** and **defense**. If by attacking the computer will win then the move will be set to win, otherwise it will try to prevent the user from winning. However, there is a third scenario where the computer will chose a random spot. This will occur in earlier stages of the game to make it less predictive.
